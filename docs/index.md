## Welcome to My Page

### About Me

My name is Kevin Angotti; I am a recent graduate from Bellevue Unversity. I earned my Master of Science in Data Science in March 2021. I am a United States Air Force Reservist stationed at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom. My focus in data science has been on EDA and data visualizations. Have a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science, and I have enjoyed combining the two fields during my Internship at NOAA.   

### Work

I currently work at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as an intern in the IT department. 
While attending Bellevue University, I have worked on data projects that range from analyzing police shootings in the United States to predicting where the best Airbnb location within a city is based on a budget and review rating.
