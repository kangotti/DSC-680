This repo contains the project data and models used to predict police shootings in the United States. 
Police shootings are a hot button topic in the United States as their frequency increases year over year. 
By examining data provided by the FBI, the project team will provide insights into factors contributing to these shootings that may aid in reducing their numbers.

The project's main goal was to determine if the fatal shooting could be predicted based on race, age, or signs of mental illness. 
The project concluded that more data would need to be used for a solid prediction. The R-Squared value of the linear regression model was not significant 
enough to provide good analysis. The project's bright spot was the decision tree and how the results could provide a good idea of where and how the shooting occurred. 
The data map also provided also gives a good sense of where shootings have occurred throughout the country.
