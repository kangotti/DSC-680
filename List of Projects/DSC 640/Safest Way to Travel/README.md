The repo contains all data and different analytic approaches that can be used to look at a problem. The project was to create a dashboard, PowerPoint, Blog post, 
infographic, and finally tie it together with a video presentation. This was my first interaction with a blog and an infographic; both were very informative in understanding how to publicize a project.

The data was pulled from the Nation Highway and Safety Board as well as the FAA. The project's main scope was to see if Airline travel was a safe option compared to other modes of transportation. Motor vehicle travel is used as the primary opposition to air travel. The project concluded that though airline travel gets 
higher fatalities per crash, the volume is not as high as a motor vehicle, and air travel is the safer option.
