The repo contains all data and different analytic approaches that can be used to look at a problem. The project was to create a dashboard, PowerPoint, Blog post, 
infographic, and finally tie it all together with a video presentation. 

The data was pulled from the Nation Highway and Safety Board as well as the FAA. The project's main scope was to see if Airline travel was a safe option compared 
to other modes of transportation. Motor vehicle travel is used as the primary opposition to air travel. The project concluded that though airline travel gets 
higher fatalities per crash, the volume is not as high as a motor vehicle and that air travel is the safer option.
